# ðŸ‘• KidFit - Kids' Clothing Size Predictor

KidFit is a machine learning web application that predicts a child's clothing size based on their **height**, **weight**, **age**, and **gender**. Built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**, it provides an easy-to-use interface for parents or retailers to determine ideal clothing sizes for kids.
